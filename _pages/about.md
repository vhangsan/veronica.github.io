Hi, I am Veronica! I am a rising senior at UC Davis pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a strong interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I'm currently part of a fellowship with [Cornell University](https://tech.cornell.edu/impact/break-through-tech/break-through-ai/), where I'm collaborating with [Fermata Energy](https://fermataenergy.com/) on a project focused on predicting load forecasting for electric vehicles.

Previously, I interned at [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/), where I contributed to managing REST APIs and developed a semantic search application to improve the company's metadata management.
